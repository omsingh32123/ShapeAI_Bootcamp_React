        According to consensus in modern genetics anatomically modern humans
        first arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa between 73,000 and
        55,000 years ago. However, the earliest known human remains in South
        Asia date to 30,000 years ago. Settled life, which involves the
        transition from foraging to farming and pastoralism, began in South Asia
        around 7,000 BCE.
